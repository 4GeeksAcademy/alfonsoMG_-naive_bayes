# Comment Classification Project with Naive Bayes

## Description

This repository contains an academic project focused on implementing a machine learning model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm for classifying comments as negative or non-negative. The main objective is to provide a pedagogical experience, open to improvements and contributions.

## Project Structure

- **/src:** Contains the main Jupyter Notebook script for model implementation.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Import:** Start by importing the .csv file containing the comments for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Perform thorough data cleaning, selecting only relevant words and excluding symbols, numbers, and words with fewer than 3 letters.

3. **Data Splitting:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model implementation.

4. **Naive Bayes Alternatives:** Explore three variants of the Naive Bayes algorithm for comparison and evaluation.

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Conduct a grid search through hyperparameters to address overfitting and improve model accuracy.

6. **Confusion Matrix:** Visually present the confusion matrix to analyze the model results in terms of true and false positives and negatives.

## Conclusion

The main conclusion revolves around the overfitting challenge despite encouraging results. The significance of hyperparameter optimization is emphasized, and a potential review of data cleaning is suggested for future improvements.

## Contributions

This project is open to contributions and suggestions. If you have ideas to enhance the model or the process, feel free to fork the repository and propose changes!

## Note

This project is part of an educational series, and the main script is located in the /src directory in Jupyter Notebook format.
